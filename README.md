10. A database approach addresses several of the problems and challenges associated with the traditional file-based approach. Using a DBMS to control how data is shared with different applications and users, trough applications such as views, has a number of advantages. However, the implementation of a database approach has its own challenges, such as expense. Discuss the various costs associated with the implementation of a database approach.
